# ðŸš€ Event-Driven AI with Java

This project explores how to integrate **event-driven systems (Kafka, Spring Boot)** with **AI capabilities (LangChain4j, OpenAI, Vector DBs)**.  
The goal: build **real-time, intelligent pipelines** where AI is not just an endpoint, but part of the event flow.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Event-driven architecture using **Apache Kafka** + **Spring Cloud Stream**  
- AI integration via **LangChain4j** and **OpenAI API**  
- Vector database support (**PGVector**) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- **Caching with Caffeine** to optimize cost/latency  
- REST + WebSocket APIs for live insights  
- Secure with **JWT authentication**  
- Containerized setup via **Docker Compose**
